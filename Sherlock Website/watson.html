                <p class="para" style="text-align:center">Dr. John Hamish Watson (PhD and MD) is the best friend and assistant of Sherlock Holmes and a former British Army doctor. Before marrying Mary Morstan, he lived at 221B Baker Street with Sherlock, a flat they rented from Mrs Hudson. He lived with Mary, whom he worked with before developing a romantic relationship. </p>

<p class="para" style="text-align:center">John is extremely brave, resourceful and practical. He is extremely loyal to Sherlock, and will usually, but not always, do what Sherlock asks him to, and cares a great deal about his well-being. Sherlock likewise cares about John. He is also very selfless and modest, as he puts himself at colossal personal risks to help Sherlock Holmes and is rather sceptical about his companion's ideals. He is very sarcastic and has an erratic sense of humour.</p>
        
<p class="para" style="text-align:center">Due to his military career, John is incredibly proficient with firearms, far more so than Sherlock or Lestrade, proving to be able to judge the distance and split-second timing of a shot across a large area with two windows in the way, and fatally wound his target while missing Sherlock, who was standing very close to the target.
    <p class="para" style="text-align:center">People assumed several times that John is homosexual and in a relationship with Sherlock. However, whenever people say this John makes a point of correcting them, in noticeable contrast to Sherlock, who never responds.There is this cheeky but heartfelt rematk of Sherlock , that sums up their relatonship :</p>
    <blockquote class="q"style="font-family:24px ; font-size:22px ; color:white">"Listen, what I said before, John, I meant it. I don't have friends. I've just got one." 
    -- Sherlock to John.</blockquote> 

<p class="para" style="text-align:center"> For his performance in the role he won the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor, 2011 and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.</p>
