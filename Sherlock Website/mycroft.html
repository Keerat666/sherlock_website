                <p class="para" style="text-align:center">Mycroft Holmes is Sherlock Holmes' brother and is traditionally older by seven years. It is not verified if he is older by seven years in the BBC version of the show.Mycroft claims to merely "occupy a minor position in the government". However, according to Sherlock, he occasionally is the British Government, functioning as the control centre or "clearing house" for all government actions and decisions. Mycroft tells John in the pilot that Sherlock may even consider him his arch-enemy. Sherlock neither confirms nor denies this statement. </p>

<p class="para" style="text-align:center">Mycroft has a habit of kidnapping people to talk to them, instead of using more conventional methods. He has very good connections; it is implied by Sherlock that he knows the Queen, when Sherlock starts to play "God Save the Queen" on his violin, and he is able to pull strings to allow Sherlock access into a top secret military base. In this episode, it is also asserted that his priority level is "Ultra". Unlike his brother, Mycroft is known to only text when he cannot talk.</p>
        
        <p class="para" style="text-align:center">Mycroft is shown to be much more capable of faking normalcy than his brother, and where as Sherlock is ostracized for his behaviour, Mycroft is highly respected by his (seeming) peers. However, he is apparently just as cold as his brother, once informing him categorically that caring was not an advantage. He is thought to be very lonely and isolated. Sherlock has said this to him too, as even Sherlock has friends but Mycroft has none. Mycroft believes himself to be "living in a world of goldfish", showing how he believes himself to be surrounded by people of much lower intelligence.</p>

    - Mycroft to Sherlock </blockquote> 

<p class="para" style="text-align:center">Again, despite his seeming lack of empathy, he still cares greatly about his younger brother Sherlock as seen in the first episode, when he had informed John that he "worries about him constantly". In another episode, Sherlock and Mycroft are seen to be smoking outside their parents' house on Christmas day, where Mycroft says to Sherlock "Your loss would break my heart". He often appears in Sherlock's mind palace to offer assistance and insults. </p>
